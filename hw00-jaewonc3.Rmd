Inline equation  $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt5}{2}=$ `r ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)`


My favorite mathematical equation is Laplace's Equation:
$$\Delta f = {\frac{\delta ^2 f}{\delta x^2}}+{\frac{\delta ^2 f}{\delta y^2}}+{\frac{\delta ^2 f}{\delta z^2}}=0$$



##Exericise 5: Got Code?

```{r}
divide = function(a, b) {
  return(a / b)
}

divide(8, 2)

```

You can prevent display of the result by setting the chunk option `results='hide'`.
```{r, results='hide'}
divide = function(a, b) {
  return(a / b)
}

divide(8, 2)

```

You don't lose syntax highlighting, but you only hide the results of the code.

There is another way to get similar response; by having it evaluate only code line 1 and 2.

```{r, eval=1:2}
divide = function(a, b) {
  return(a / b)
}

divide(8, 2)

```

if you do not want your code run, you can set the chunk option `eval = FALSE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
divide = function(a, b) {
  return(a / b)
}

divide(8, 2)

```

if i want to share divide function without syntax highlighting,
```
divide = function(a, b) {
  return(a / b)
}

divide(8, 2)
```
This approach excludes syntax highlighting, but 
it is an inline code, not a code chunk.


##Exercise 6: Hopeless Wanderer

$(\frac{6}{3}-1)+2*5^2=$ `r ((6/3-1)+2*5^2)`


```{r}

add = function(a, b) {
  message("ADD")
  return(a + b)
}

subtract = function(a, b) {
  message("SUBTRACT")
  return(a - b)
}

multiply = function(a, b) {
  message("MULTIPLY")
  return(a * b)
}

divide = function(a, b) {
  message("DIVIDE")
  return(a / b)
}

power = function(a,b){
  message("POWER")
  return(a ^ b)
}

add((subtract(divide(6,3),1)),multiply(2, power(5,2)))


```


Evaluation order changes when
```{r}

add = function(a, b) {
  message("ADD:", a, ",", b)
  return(a + b)
}

subtract = function(a, b) {
  message("SUBTRACT:", a, ",", b)
  return(a - b)
}

multiply = function(a, b) {
  message("MULTIPLY:", a, ",", b)
  return(a * b)
}

divide = function(a, b) {
  message("DIVIDE:", a, ",", b)
  return(a / b)
}

power = function(a,b){
  message("POWER:", a, ",", b)
  return(a ^ b)
}

add((subtract(divide(6,3),1)),multiply(2, power(5,2)))


```
my guess is that for the former code prints message as soon as it meets the code, but the latter awaits until there is a return value of `a` and `b` until it prints messages.
